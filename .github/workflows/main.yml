name: CI

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the master branch
  push:
    branches: [ master ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ master ]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
        # generates a snake game from a github user (<github_user_name>) contributions graph, output a svg animation at <svg_out_path>
      - name: generate github-contribution-grid-snake.svg
        uses: Platane/snk@master
        with:
          github_user_name: ${{ github.repository_owner }}
          svg_out_path: dist/github-contribution-grid-snake.svg

      # Runs a set of commands using the runners shell

          echo Add other actions to build,
          echo test, and deploy your project.
